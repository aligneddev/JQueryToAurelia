# Solar Energy project implemented in Angular 2.0

## Getting Started

I'm using Angular 2.0 and the latest [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/). I used Visual Studio Code for my editor, but any text editor or IDE should work.

`npm install -g angular-cli@latest`
I created the project using `ng new`.

### Run the site

To run the project `ng serve --watch`. This will watch for file changes and reload the browser with BrowserSync.
I saw `** NG Live Development Server is running on http://localhost:4200. **` in the console and things are working.
It took 4.83 seconds to get things running.
After saving, it takes about 2 to 5 seconds for the webpack build and the browser sync reload to complete. I wonder what this will be for a large TS project...

`ng serve --prod` to serve 'minified'.
3 bundles in js files, inline, styles, main with cache busting int the name. There is about 210Kb of JavaScript.
3 files, but 2.6 MB.

The CLI project is using [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/).

### Create a component

`ng g component energy`
this creates a folder `energy` with the component, spec, html and css files. It also sets it up in the app.module.

### http

[HTTP with Promises](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/tutorial/toh-pt6.html)

I [simulated the WebApi](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/tutorial/toh-pt6.html) (search for app.module.ts (v2) in this page) so I wouldn't have to bring in Asp.Net to this project.
return {yearOptions, solar} corresponds with the api/yearOptions and api/solar? in the energy-data.service.ts
[more on in-mem-web-api](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/server-communication.html#!#in-mem-web-api).
[another example](https://github.com/angular/in-memory-web-api/blob/master/examples/hero-data.service.ts)

However, I then changed it just to grab the json from the energy-data.service.ts.

### energy data row

I considered a component for each row (as I did in Aurelia with the EnergyDataRowViewModel and template.html), but (click) on the tr should work fine.
I will consider changing the Aurelia approach, but that was done to show the templating/component feature in that project.

### external libraries

Bringing in BootStrap
Using the [ng-BootStrap](https://ng-bootstrap.github.io/#/getting-started).
[StackOverflow help](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/38413044/how-to-add-ng-bootstrap-to-an-angular-cli-broccoli-version-project)
`npm install --save @ng-bootstrap/ng-bootstrap`

in angular-cli.json
add `"../node_modules/@ng-bootstrap/ng-bootstrap/bundles/ng-bootstrap.js"` to scripts
and `"../node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css"` to styles
others can be placed in the [angular-cli.json scripts array](http://blog.dmbcllc.com/adding-css-and-javascript-to-an-angular-2-cli-project/) or [docs](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli#global-library-installation).

// this caused me this grief, that is still there [my reported issue](https://github.com/ng-bootstrap/ng-bootstrap/issues/1104) and [on SO](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/40915311/angular-2-2-and-ng-bootstrap-cannot-read-property-observable-of-undefined)

`VM35625:9 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'Observable' of undefined(â€¦)webpackUniversalModuleDefinition @ VM35625:9(anonymous function) @ VM35625:10module.exports @ scripts.bundle.js:28369 @ scripts.bundle.js:6__webpack_require__ @ inline.bundle.js:53694 @ scripts.bundle.js:37__webpack_require__ @ inline.bundle.js:53webpackJsonpCallback @ inline.bundle.js:24(anonymous function) @ scripts.bundle.js:1

that I was unable to get around.

## Routing for Master Details

clicking on the row will navigate to the details view using the router.
[docs on Routing](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/tutorial/toh-pt5.html)
[docs on Master/Details in the same page](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/tutorial/toh-pt2.html)

* "Note how the switchMap operator maps the id in the observable route parameters to a new Observable, the result of the HeroService.getHero method.
 If the user re-navigates to this component while a getHero request is still inflight, switchMap cancels that old request before calling HeroService.getHero again."
* "The hero id is a number. Route parameters are always strings. So we convert the route parameter value to a number with the JavaScript (+) operator."

## This was copied from CLI generated Readme

This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.21.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.

## Deploying to Github Pages

Run `ng github-pages:deploy` to deploy to Github Pages.
